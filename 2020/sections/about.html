<h1 class="section-header">What is HackOHI/O?</h1>

<p>
    HackOHI/O this year is a 48 hour hackathon that attracts over 800 participants annually for a full weekend of coding,
    building, learning, networking, and innovation.
    HackOHI/O gives students a unique opportunity to jumpstart a project in an environment that's all about supporting
    them. This will be the first virtually held HackOHI/O.
</p>

<p>
    Teams will come up with an idea themselves or can be inspired by challenges presented by our supporting companies
    and organizations.
    After the 48 hours are over, teams present their project to judges to compete for prizes and could possibly win
    funding and further opportunities to continue their project!
</p>

<p>
    HackOHI/O is put on by a student-run organization called OHI/O. We are a small but mighty team of students that plan
    and organize sponsorship, logistics, branding, marketing and website of HackOHI/O.
    OHI/O is dedicated to creating opportunities for students to use their skills to create impactful and innovative
    projects.
