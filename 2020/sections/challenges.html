            Azure Cognitive Services are a set of tools you can use to add intelligence to your apps and projects.
            This includes services for image processing, natural language processing, recommendations, search, and much
            more.
            What can we build with Azure Cognitive Services? Anything and everything!
            We encourage you to think about how AI can address a user problem.
            For example, how can you use AI to improve student life or day to day productivity?

            Demonstrate how batteries can benefit customers and the environment.
            Specifically, using records of historical energy consumption, approximate cost structure, and details of
            different battery systems, identify customers who are the best candidates for installing a battery system
            and build a business case to show them the benefits.
            Additionally, investigate how such battery systems can reduce the impact on the environment without reducing
            total energy consumption.
            As a bonus challenge, recommend changes to the cost structure that would incentivize increased battery
            deployments.

            Develop a web or mobile application that allows drivers to explore their own driving data and incentivizes
            them to improve their driving behaviors.
            The specifics of how you tackle this are up to you, but it should provide compelling and useful information
            to drivers, and be an application that our drivers are excited to use.

            Create a concept to display data in either a mobile application (e.g. on a forklift or mobile device) or a
            web application that provides enhanced safety, increased productivity, and/or improves autonomous
            operations.
            A pre-populated data set will be available via REST APIs hosted in a cloud environment, however, a custom
            data set may be used. Potential users can be forklift operators, warehouse supervisors, or pedestrians
            working around autonomous forklifts.

            Create a dashboard displaying energy data from the 490 buildings at Ohio State.
            What does it look like? How does it function? How would you make kilowatt hours and BTUs understandable to
            the general population?
            Your project has the chance to be implemented right here at Ohio State and impact over 100,000 people every
            day.
