            <p>
                A significant proportion of traffic accidents result from driver inattention and
                speeding. Making information available to drivers to inform them of when they are
                engaging in risky driving behavior is pivotal to the reduction of traffic accidents.
                Providing explicit online feedback through dashboard features can be counterintuitive
                by drawing attention away from the road.
                Utilizing cutting edge perceptual research, we propose a mechanism of implicit
                feedback (through tactile and auditory methods) to indicate when drivers engage
                in risky behavior. By modelling online driving data based on smart car sensors,
                subtle vibrations through the steering wheel or auditory noise can be used to
                highlight the need to reduce speed when approaching a breaking car or turning a
                corner too fast in the rain. These methods may help encourage drivers to attend to
                information related to dangerous conditions during and after risky scenarios.

                Full-stack data analysis web application made with React.js, Next.js, and
                Tailwind.css for the front-end; Python, Flask, and numpy for the webserver api;
                and SQLite for the database. We created multiple interactive graphs with the given
                information as well as extrapolated data using linear regression on the given
                information. These graphs include: total prescriptions for all doctors for each
                medicine per month, top doctors for new prescriptions for each medicine per month,
                and dynamic profile pages for each doctor with their own trends for new prescriptions
                and total prescriptions as well as predicted values for each. This is a great base
                to expand upon with more features and would be especially useful if more data was
                given.

                We designed a web and Windows application that allows users to input a CSV file
                containing  data on Doctors, their location, and their monthly prescriptions. Our
                app then processes and interprets this data into interactive and meaningful charts,
                graphs, and lists. We have interactive lists that organizes data by specified states
                and by products. Aesthetic line graphs and pie charts containing information on total
                prescriptions by product. As well as predictions for future top doctors and future
                total prescriptions by product, using methods from Statistical Analysis.
