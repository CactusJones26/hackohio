        <h3>
            What is a hackathon?
        </h3>
        <p>
            A hackathon is not a cybersecurity hacking contest. It is more like "life hacks"
            and to find work-arounds and unique solutions. Hackathons are events that usually
            range from a few hours to a few days where participants work together to design,
            build, and present a tech project. This hackathon is a 24-hour team-based event.
            Ideas and designs are important, and we also encourage technical implementation of
            basic prototypes.

    <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>
            Will the hackathon be virtual?
        </h3>
        <p>
            This year we will be hosting a hybrid event that is virtual and in-person.
            While we encourage teams to attend in person, there are ways for students,
            sponsors, and mentors to join us virtually and still participate. Stay tuned
            for more details.

            Who can attend?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Anyone who is a student at a university! (AKA if you have a .edu email address)
            We encourage all levels of expertise to join. Whether this is your first hackathon,
            or you've been to hackathons around the nation, HackOHI/O provides an opportunity to
            collaborate and create something amazing.

        <h3>
            How does registration work?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The registration for HackOHI/O 2021 is open! Please sign up  <a href="https://reghackohio.com/">here</a>!
            Since we are planning to feed you free meals, we will also have a
            confirmation process in October to confirm your participation method,
            and dietary restrictions. You must visit the reghackohio.com link and
            confirm by Oct 20!  If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to
            <a href="mailto:registerhackohio@gmail.com">registerhackohio@gmail.com</a>.

    <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>
            How do I join a team?
        </h3>
        <p>
            After verifying your account, you can pick a team to join in the registration portal.
            Teams can be anywhere from 2-4 members, and we require for all participants to be in a
            team to be eligible for judging. If you are looking for a team, we'll be providing
            opportunities before and during the hackathon to find one. We'll be posting more information
            on team formation events in our newsletters and on our social media accounts - be on the lookout!

    <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>
            What if I have no programming experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
            That's okay! One of the goals of a hackathon is to learn new skills, and we will
            have mentors available to help you throughout your project. We will also host
            workshops prior to the hackathon to introduce you to new programming languages
            and/or tools. And remember, there are other ways to help out a team in their
            development beyond programming.

    <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>
            Is it free?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yes, this event is free for all participants! We would like to thank our generous sponsors and supporters
            for making this possible.

    <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>
            Do I need to have an idea beforehand?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Nope! Many participants come up with their ideas at the hackathon. Challenges presented by our
            sponsors will be released the week before, which also spark idea formation (and the chance
            for additional prizes!)

    <div class="faq-question">
        <h3>
            Can I work on my project before this event?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The spirit of a hackathon is to see what you can accomplish in one weekend.
            Although we will not prevent students from entering with pre-built components,
            when you enter your project for judging we ask that you are honest and transparent
            with the judges about what and how much was accomplished during HackOHI/O. For more
            details, see our

            This year we are taking your requests for hardware during the registration process.
            Any reasonable request will be honored (small microcontrollers, disposable components,
            etc.) and you may get those at HackOHI/O. And of course you are more than welcome to
            still build with your own materials!
